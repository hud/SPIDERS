This folder includes the MATLAB GUI used during the preliminary experiment.
There are three tests in this GUI, which are picture, sound, and video. Materials for picture and sound stimulus are acquired from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) and the International Affective Digitized Sound system (IADS). The video stimulus are acquired from Youtube.
PictureStim.mat, SoundStim.mat, and VideoStim.mat are the stimulus order used for the three tests.
