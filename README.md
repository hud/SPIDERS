# SPIDERS
We propose a System for Processing In-situ Bio-signal Data for Emotion Recognition and Sensing in the form factor of glasses, that combines customized modular bio-signal acquisition circuit with a suite of algorithm and machine-learning based classifiers to produce accurate bio-signals and emotion classes. The proposed platform uses data from noncontact sensors to provide: 1) eye & eyebrow detection, 2) pupillometry, 3) zygomaticus muscle (smile muscle) movements, and 4) head movements. The platform can also be extended to include functionalities provided by contact-based sensors, such as 5) heart rate and 6) 8-channel EEG.
